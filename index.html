      <h1>JavaScript (JS)</h1>
      <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. Like HTML and CSS, you do not need to install anything to begin writing JavaScript or see it run on your users' computers. All modern browsers support JavaScript which means JavaScript that you write for your web pages will automatically run when your visitors load your web page in their browsers. In fact, JavaScript is the only scripting language that all browsers support so if you want a page to have dynamic content, learning JavaScript is a must.</p>

      <h1>jQuery</h1>
      <p>is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to incorporate JavaScript on your web pages. When we say it is a library, we mean that many common tasks that would take many, many lines of JavaScript code to execute have been packaged into methods that you'll be able to use with a single line of code. These methods are always available and ready to use the same way you might check out a book at a library. The goal of jQuery is to allow its users to "write less, do more". It's also one of the primary ways we can add interactivity to our sites.</p>

      <h1>Operators</h1>

      <h1>Variable</h1>

      <h1>Methods</h1>
      <p>A method is an action run on a piece of data; you can think of it as a message you send to a piece of data, and the result is the response.</p>
